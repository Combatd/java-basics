## Opening (5 min)

So far, we've stored all of the information for our programs in individual variables. That works for a small amount of information, but what if we had to manage larger sets of data? For instance, what if we had credit card transactions in a customer's banking app? Would we want to store every transaction in its own variable or have a single variable hold all transactions at once?

>  In pairs, take 1–2 minutes to come up with a few more examples of when storing our data in a collection would be beneficial (data situations or sample programs).

## Introduction: Basic Arrays (5 min)

An array is a container object that holds a **fixed** number of values of **a single type**. You've already seen an example in the `main` method.

<!-- **Instructor Note**: Draw a picture on the board similar to the one below to visually display each element and corresponding index.-->

<details>

<summary> Knowledge Check: This is different than arrays in JavaScript. How so?</summary>

   In JS, arrays aren't fixed in size.

</details>

Each item in an array is called an **element**, and each element can be accessed by its **index**. The index of elements starts at `0`. Visually, this means:

  INDEX  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
  -------|---|---|---|---|---
| ELEMENT| x | x | x | x | x |

> **Knowledge Check**: If a fixed size is required, how would we add more space?

----

## Demo: Creating Arrays (5 min)

Let's create an array together:

<!-- **Instructor Note**: Explain each piece of syntax here.-->

```java
  class ArrayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Declares an array of integers.
      int[] anArray; // Note data type, followed by [] indicating array.

      // Allocates memory for 10 integers:
      anArray = new int[10];

      // Assign elements:
      anArray[0] = 111;
      anArray[1] = 222; // And so on...

      // Access elements:
      System.out.println("Element at index 0: " + anArray[0]);
      System.out.println("Element at index 1: " + anArray[1]); // and so on
      System.out.println("The array has a size of " + anArray.length);
    }
  }
```

> **Knowledge Check**: How would you find the index of the last element in the array using the `length` property?

----

## Independent Practice: Creating Arrays (10 min)

Create a `String` array containing **three** of your favorite things. Print the result to the command line.

<!--**Instructor Note**: Review how you would create `String[] favoriteThings;`-->

<details>
  
<summary>Check: What are the three steps of creating an array?</summary>

  1. Declare variable.
  2. Allocate memory.
  3. Initialize or assign values.

</details> 

----

## Demo: Manipulating Arrays (15 min)

Arrays can also be created and initialized with one statement. The length of the array is automatically determined by the number of elements inside the curly braces.

```java
  class FavoriteThings {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Shortened syntax: Assign variable, allocate memory, and initialize values all in one statement.
      String[] favoriteThings = {
        "raindrops",
        "roses",
        "whiskers on kittens"
      } // Length will be inferred as 3.
    }
  }
```

#### Manipulating Basic Arrays

Let's take a look at some basic things you can do with an array.

Note that indexing (getting or setting the item based on its position in the array) and determining the length of the array have built-in syntax, while some less fundamental operations are performed by using methods on the `Arrays` object. This is similar to adding two numbers together by writing `a + b`, but using methods on the `Math` object to do more esoteric things like rounding.

```java
  import java.util.Arrays;

  class ArrayManipulationDemo {
        // Initialize array:
        int[] primeNumbers = {5,3,11,7,2}; // next 13, 17, 19, 23

        // Get the element at a specified index:
        int firstPrime = primeNumbers[0];
        System.out.println("index 0: " + firstPrime);

        // Print it:
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(primeNumbers));

        // Sort it:
        Arrays.sort(primeNumbers);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(primeNumbers));

        // Get its length:
        System.out.println(primeNumbers.length); // it's a constant, not a method (we'll talk about this later)

        // See if value is found in array, returns -1 if not found.
        // Note: binarySearch() only works if the array is sorted:
        int indexOf11 = Arrays.binarySearch(primeNumbers, 11);
        System.out.println("index of 11: " + indexOf11);

        // Check: how to get the value?
        // if(indexOf11 >= 0) {
            System.out.println("looking for 11, found value: " + primeNumbers[indexOf11]);
        // }
  }
```

#### Error Checking

Now, what if we searched for a value that isn't in the array? Let's see if `10` is a prime number.

<!-- **Instructor Note**: Add the lines below, leaving out the commented code. Throw the exception, ask the students why it was thrown, and ONLY THEN should you add in the >=0 check commented out above and below.-->

```java
int[] primeNumbers = {5,3,11,7,2};

int indexOf10 = Arrays.binarySearch( primeNumbers, 10 );
System.out.println( "index of 10: " + indexOf10 );
	// if(indexOf10 >= 0) {
		System.out.println("looking for 10, found value: " + primeNumbers[indexOf10]);
	// }
```

An exception is thrown when the computer is asked to do something it can't do, like accessing index `-1` or `4` in a four-element array. Exceptions bubble up and, unless caught (which we'll talk about in a later lesson), cause the program to quit.

It's important to consider when the results of our actions might throw an exception and add checks as needed.

> **Knowledge Check**: If an array is five elements long, what happens if we look for `myArray[5]`?

----

## Demo: Problems With Arrays (10 min)

What if we decide we want an array to include four things instead of three? For example, let's go back to our `favoriteThings` array and add `"chocolate"` as the fourth favorite thing:

```java
  public static void addFourthFav() {
    String[] favoriteThings = {"roses","whiskers on kittens","raindrops"};
    favoriteThings[3] = "chocolate"; // check: why 3 and not 4?
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(favoriteThings));
  }
```

That throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Why? As mentioned, arrays are fixed in size. To add `"chocolate"` as a fourth item in the array, we would have to create a new array of a larger size, copy the info over, and then initialize the additional elements:

```java
  public static void addFourthFav() {
    String[] favoriteThings = {"roses","whiskers on kittens","raindrops"};
    String[] favoriteThingsLarge = new String[4];

    System.arraycopy(favoriteThings, 0, favoriteThingsLarge, 0, 3);
    favoriteThingsLarge[3] = "chocolate";

    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(favoriteThingsLarge));
  }
```

Fortunately, Java has provided something better: **collections**.

----

## Demo: Collections (15 min)

Collections not only provide us with more convenience methods — allowing us to do more things with the data we have — they also **increase in size automatically** if needed.

Just like data types, we can use many different collection classes, each of which provides some distinct functionality. But for today, we'll focus on just one of them: `ArrayList`.

#### `ArrayList`

Let's take the array we made of favorite things and convert it into an `ArrayList`:

```java
  import java.util.ArrayList;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      // initialize ArrayList
      ArrayList<String> favoriteThings = new ArrayList<>();
      
      // add items
      favoriteThings.add("bright copper kettles");
      favoriteThings.add("brown paper packages tied up with strings");
  }
```

Note that the data type of each element is defined in angle brackets, `<>`. This data type could be any object type. So, if you created a `Person` object, you could create an `ArrayList` of `Person` (i.e., an `ArrayList<Person>`).

If you want to make an `ArrayList` of a primitive type, you need to use a "boxed" version of that type in the angle brackets. For example, if you want to store data of type `int`, you would use an `ArrayList<Integer>`.

#### Manipulating an `ArrayList`

An `ArrayList` is an object with methods, which makes it much easier to manipulate than a simple array.

Check out the following methods:

```java
    // To print, no need to explicitly convert it to a String first
    // because ArrayList has a toString() method, which automatically gets called here:
    System.out.println("favoriteThings = " + favoriteThings);

    // add(item) adds to the end of the list:
    favoriteThings.add("chocolate");
    System.out.println("favoriteThings = " + favoriteThings);

    // add(index, item) adds to the list at the specified index and moves all other entries over.
    // Check: What you would have to do with a simple array in order to do that?
    favoriteThings.add(1, "warm woolen mittens");
    System.out.println("favoriteThings = " + favoriteThings);

    // set(index, item) replaces the item at the given index with a new one:
    favoriteThings.set(0, "tarnished copper kettles");
    System.out.println("favoriteThings = " + favoriteThings);

    // To search for an entry:
    int indexOfIceCream = favoriteThings.indexOf("icecream");
    if(indexOfIceCream != -1) {
      String ic = favoriteThings.get(indexOfIceCream);
      System.out.println("ic = " + ic);
    } else {
      System.out.println("icecream not found");
    }

    // Here's another good one: To get number of things in the ArrayList:
    favoriteThings.size();
```

## Guided Practice: Iterating Through a List With `for` Loops (15 min)

#### The `for` Loop

Remember the `for` loop? We used it in the control flow lesson to print something to the command line a set number of times.

> **Knowledge Check**: What's the syntax of a basic `for` loop?

The `for` loop is also commonly used with arrays and collections to iterate through each of the elements and do something with each entry.

For example, let's create a list of five movies and iterate through it, printing each one to the command line.

<!-- **Instructor Note**: Get movie suggestions from the class. -->

```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<String> movieList = new ArrayList<>();
    movieList.add(/*student suggestion here*/); // x5
    printMovies(movieList);
  }

  public static void printMovies(ArrayList<String> movies) {
    for (int i = 0; i < movies.size(); i++) {
      System.out.println("where i = " + i + ": " + movies.get(i));
    }
  }

```

To recap, a `for` loop has an initialization stage (where `i` is initialized), a termination condition (which includes the logic for when the loop stops), and an increment stage (which will occur upon the completion of each loop).

#### The Enhanced `for` Loop

There's also another `for` loop syntax made especially for arrays and lists. This is sometimes referred to as the **enhanced** `for` loop:

```java
 for (String movie : movieList) {
  System.out.println("I love " + movie + "!");
 }
```

The enhanced `for` loop is the form recommended by Oracle for arrays and collections.

A normal `for` loop is still useful sometimes: It makes it easier to work with the index of each item alongside its value or modify the collection while you're iterating over it. But, if you just need to do something with each element, the enhanced `for` loop is cleaner and more efficient.

## Independent Practice: Arrays and Array Lists (15 min)

Work through as many of the following challenges as you can in the next 15 minutes. Each should be completed in its own method.

#### Find the Size

1. Create an array of type `int`.
1. Print the length of the array to the command line.

#### Concrete Jungle

1. Create an `ArrayList` of New York City wildlife.
1. Create a function that, given an `ArrayList` of strings, prints for each element: "Today, I spotted a /*Thing here*/ in the concrete jungle."

#### Sum It Up 

Create a method that, given an array of type `int`, returns the sum of the first two elements in the array. If the array length is `1`, just return the single element, and return `0` if the array is empty (has `length 0`).

#### Igpay Atinlay

Create a method that, given an `ArrayList` of words (`String`s), turns each word into Pig Latin. The rules of Pig Latin are as follows:
- The first consonant is moved to the end of the word and suffixed with an "-ay." 
- If a word begins with a vowel, just add "-way" to the end.
- For example, pig becomes "igpay," banana becomes "ananabay," twig becomes "wigtay," and aardvark becomes "aardvarkway."
