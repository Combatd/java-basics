## Opening (5 min)

> Control flow structures are an important aspect of programming languages that allow your code to take certain actions based on a variety of scenarios. Control flow is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to dictate how your code runs under different conditions or until a certain condition is met.

*The text above is from culttt.com.*

Control flow is a concept that's consistent across most programming languages. The components of control flow (loops, `if...else` conditionals, `switch` statements, comparison operators) are also universal principles.

What varies is the way different control flow components are implemented from language to language. Let's see how it's done in Java.

Java supports a compact set of statements — specifically control flow statements — that you can use to incorporate interactivity in your application.

-----

## Introduction: Logical Operators and Control Flow (10 min)

#### Block Statements

Statements meant to be executed after a control flow operation will be grouped into a **block statement**. These statements are wrapped around a pair of curly braces:

```java
{
  System.out.println("hello");
  System.out.println("roar");
}
```

#### Block Scope

Scope changes depending on whether a variable is defined in the class (we use the `mVariableName` convention for these) or in a method (these variables have local scope only and are not available outside that method).

In Java, variables defined in **block statements** modify scope, meaning those variables are not available outside of the block.

<!-- **Instructor Note**: Show the scope error in the IDE, then correct it as shown in the second code block.-->

For example:

```java
boolean beautiful = true;

if (beautiful)
{
  String name = "lydia";
}

System.out.println(name); // symbol 'name' cannot be resolved
```

Variables defined in **block statements** are not available outside of the curly braces. How might we resolve this issue?

<!-- **Instructor Note**: First, try to print out `name` without an `else` statement, then add the `else` when the program still won't compile.-->

```java
boolean beautiful = true;
String name = "pepe";

if (beautiful)
{
  name = "robin"; // Use the predefined variable.
}

System.out.println(name); //=> robin
```

-----

## Demo: Conditional Statements (10 min)

Conditional statements are a way of skipping over a block of code if it doesn't pass a Boolean expression. Java supports two conditional statements: `if...else` and `switch`.

#### `if...else` Statements

```java
if (expr) {
    code
} else {
    other code
}
```

This means run the `code` block if `expr` is `true`, otherwise (if `expr` is `false`), run the `other code` block:

```java
int i = 9;

if (i > 0) {
    System.out.println("hi");
} else {
    System.out.println("goodbye");
}
//=> hi
```

When you need to test more than one case, you may use `else...if`:

```java
String name = "kittens";

if (name.equals("puppies")) {
    name += "!!!";
} else if (name.equals("kittens")) {
    name += "!!";
} else {
    name = "!" + name;
}

System.out.println(name); //=> "kittens!!"
```

#### Ternary Operator

Java has a ternary operator for conditional expressions. You can think of the ternary operator as a concise `if...else` in one line:

```java
int age = 12;

String allowed = (age > 18) ? "yes" : "no";

System.out.println(allowed); //=> "no"
```
-----

## Guided Practice: Boolean or Logical Operators (15 min)

[Logical operators](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/opsummary.html) will always return a Boolean value, `true` or `false`.

There are two binary operators that require two values:
- **`AND`**, denoted `&&`.
- **`OR`**, denoted `||`.

A third unary operator requires only one value:

* **`NOT`**, denoted `!`.

#### `&&` (`AND`)

The `&&` operator requires both values to its left and right to be `true` in order to evaluate the entire statement as `true`:

```java
boolean result = false;

if (true && true) {
  result = true;
}

System.out.println(result); //=> true
```

Any other combination using the `&&` operator is `false`.

What happens if I check `true && false`?

```java
boolean result = false;

if (true && false) {
  result = true;
}

System.out.println(result); //=> false
```

```java
boolean result = false;

if (false && false) {
  result = true;
}

System.out.println(result); //=> false
```

#### `||` (`OR`)

The `||` operator requires just one of the left or right values to be `true` in order to evaluate the entire statement as `true`.

So, if I do `true || false`, what will be returned?

```java
if (true || false) {
  System.out.println("true");
}
//=> true

if (false || true) {
  System.out.println("true");
}
//=> true

if (false || false) {
    System.out.println("true");
}
//=> ... silence ...
```

> **Knowledge Check**: What is the only combination that will return `false`?

Only `false || false` will return `false`.

The `!` takes a value and returns the opposite Boolean value:

```java
!(true)
//=> false
```

The `&&` and `||` operators use short-circuit logic, which means whether or not they execute their second operand depends on the first.

> **Knowledge Check**: Can you think of a time when this might be useful?

This is useful for checking for `null` objects before accessing their attributes:

```java
if (instructor != null && instructor.getName().equals("drew")) {
  System.out.println("davis");
}
```

In this case, if the first operand, `instructor != null`, is `false`, then the second operand, `instructor.getName().equals("drew")`, will not be evaluated. The expression is basically saying, "We already know the whole `&&` expression is `false` because `instructor != null` is `false`. Why bother dealing with the second operand?"

This is also important because a `NullPointerException` will be thrown if we try to call a method using "dot notation" on a `null` object reference.

## Demo: Comparison Operators (10 min)

[Comparisons](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op2.html) in Java can be made on primitives using `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.

> **Knowledge Check**: What is a primitive data type?

```java
'A' > 'a'
//=> false

'b' > 'a'
//=> true

12 > 12
//=> false

```

Note that you **cannot** do:

```java
12 >= "12"

// or

"Apple" > "Oranges"
```

#### Equality Operator `==`

When verifying equality between primitives, use `==`:

```java
System.out.println(1 == 2);
//=> false
```

But what about with objects like `String`s?

##### A Special Note on Equality Among `String`s

There are two ways to compare the equality of `String`s:

```java
String blue = "blue";
boolean withSign = (blue == "blue");            //=> true
boolean withWords = (blue).equals("blue");      //=> true
```

Do you know which one of these would be preferred?

Let's do another example to show you which and why:

```java
String blue = "blue";
String bl = "bl";
String ue = "ue";

System.out.println(bl+ue);                      //=> blue
boolean withSigns = (bl+ue == blue);            //=> false
boolean withWords = (bl+ue).equals(blue);       //=> true
```

Why isn't `withSigns` `true` when the output looks the same?

Objects and arrays are complex collections of values, and when we refer to them, we're actually referencing where they live in memory. That's why we say objects are **passed by reference**, while `int` and `float` are **passed by value**.

`==` compares the place where the object was stored on the computer. What this means is that Java doesn't care if they look similar; it only compares whether or not they're the exact same object in memory. When checking for equality in each of the cases above, we're actually comparing two objects that are in two different places in memory.

`String blue` has a reference to where it's stored on the computer, and that's a different place than where `String bl` is stored. They're not exactly the same, according to `==`.

`equals()`, on the other hand, can be called on an instance of a `String` object. This method checks if the `char` arrays in each `String` are the same, not if the references are the same.

In short, use `equals()` when comparing `String`s.

> **Knowledge Check**: Why can we call methods on a variable of a `String` data type but not on an `int`?

#### Don't Forget About Me: `!=`

There's also an `!=` operator, which is the inverse of `==`.

-----

## Introduction: `switch` Statements (10 min)

The `switch` statement can be used for multiple branches based on a number or `String`:

```java
  String food = "apple";

  switch(food) {
    case "pear":
      System.out.println("I like pears");
      break;
    case "apple":
      System.out.println("I like apples");
      break;
    default:
      System.out.println("No favorite");
  }
//=> I like apples
```

In this case, the `switch` statement compares `food` to each of the cases (`pear` and `apple`) and evaluates the expressions beneath them if there's a match. It uses the `String.equals` method in this case, or `==` in the case of primitives, to evaluate equality.

The default clause is optional.

**Note: Breaks are important.** If you don't put a `break` statement, the expression will continue to be evaluated for the next cases. This might cause unintended consequences.

For example, if you eliminate the `break` statements:

```java
  String food = "apple";

  switch(food) {
    case "pear":
      System.out.println("I like pears");
    case "apple":
      System.out.println("I like apples");
    default:
      System.out.println("No favorite");
  }
```

The result would be:

```
I like apples 
No favorite
```

If `food = "pear"`, then the output would be:

```
I like pears  
I like apples 
No favorite
```

This isn't what we intended.

## Demo: Loops (15 min)

Looping exists in just about all programming languages. A loop is a statement or block of code that will continue to execute while or until a condition exists.

`while` loops, for example, will run a block of code **while** a condition is `true`. Java has `while` loops and `do...while` loops.

The `while` loop is good for basic looping, but there's a possibility it will never run.

> **Knowledge Check**: In what case will the `while` loop never run?

```java
while (true) {
  // an infinite loop!
}
```

Using a `do...while` loop makes sure the body of the loop is executed at least once, because `while` isn't evaluated until after the block of code runs:

```java
int input = 0;

do {
  System.out.println(input++);
} while (input < 10);
```

You can use looping in combination with iteration: a way of incrementally repeating a task.

For example, using a `for` loop:

```java
int iterations = 10;

for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

Notice the placement of the semicolons. Now, let's take a look at what each of the parts do:

1. `int i = 0;` is the **initialization** phase.
  - This is executed once, before the loop begins.
  - Note that `int i` is declared within this phase. This means the lifespan of `i` is limited to within the `for` loop, which is much cleaner and leads to less problems down the line.

2. `i < iterations;` is the **termination** phase.
  - Every time the loop evaluates, it checks this statement.
  - If this statement evaluates to `false`, the loop terminates.
  - This is equivalent to the `while` section of the `do...while` loop.

3. `i++` is the **increment** expression.
  - This happens every time the loop evaluates.
  - This is equivalent to the `do` section of the `do...while` loop.
  - In this case, for each loop, `i` is incremented by `1`.

## Independent Practice: Fizz Buzz (15 min)

Fizz buzz is a game about division. Create a program that will iterate through numbers `1` to `101`, and log each number in the console.

- If the number is divisible by **three**, the word `fizz` should be logged instead of logging the number itself.
- If the number is divisible by **five**, the word `buzz` should be logged.
- If the number is divisible by both **three** and **five**, the word `fizzbuzz` should be logged.

**Hint**: Remember the **modulo** operator?

A typical output would look like this:

```java
for (int i = 1; i < 101; i++) {

  if((i % 3 == 0) && (i % 5 == 0)) {
    System.out.println("fizzbuzz");
  } else if(i % 3 == 0) {
    System.out.println("fizz");
  } else if(i % 5 == 0) {
    System.out.println("buzz");
  } else {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}
```

</details>

## Conclusion (5 min)

These are some of the foundational tools you'll use in many of your applications. You'll probably need to refresh yourself on the exact syntax a few times before you memorize it. But it's important to remember these core control flow concepts, because they'll come up in almost every programming language you'll encounter. The Java documentation on [control flow statements](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/flow.html) is a helpful reference.
