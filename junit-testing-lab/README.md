## Introduction

Using the code from a previous lab (where we wrote several basic functions), you'll write tests that pass. Here's a refresher of the functions you wrote:

- Define a function, `maxOfTwoNumbers()`, that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. I would suggest using conditional statements. Do a Google search to figure this out if you've forgotten how conditionals work.

- Define a function, `maxOfThree()`, that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.

- Write a function, `isCharacterAVowel()`, that takes a character (i.e., a string of length `1`) and returns `true` if it's a vowel and `false` otherwise.

- Write a function that returns the number of arguments passed to it when called.

- Define a function, `reverseString()`, that computes the reversal of a string. For example, `reverseString("jag testar")` should return the string `"ratset gaj"`.

**Bonus**

- Write a function, `findLongestWord()`, that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.

- Write a function, `filterLongWords()`, that takes an array of words and a number, `i`, and returns the words longer than `i` characters.

## Exercise

Start the code you already created in [this lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/GA-Cognizant/foundational-java/tree/master/java-basics/functions-lab). Write tests using JUnit to ensure each function is correct.
