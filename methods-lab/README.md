## Introduction

> **Instructor Note**: This can be a pair programming activity or done independently.

This lab provides an opportunity to practice creating methods.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

Write code that implements various methods, following the requirements listed below:

- Define a method, `maxOfTwoNumbers()`, that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. I would suggest using conditional statements. Do a Google search to figure this out if you forgot how conditionals work.

- Define a method, `maxOfThree()`, that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.

- Write a method, `isCharacterAVowel()`, that takes a character (i.e., a string of length `1`) and returns `true` if it's a vowel and `false` otherwise.

- Write a method that returns the number of arguments passed to it when called.

- Define a method, `reverseString()`, that computes the reversal of a string. For example, `reverseString("jag testar")` should return the string `"ratset gaj"`.

**Bonus**

- Write a method, `findLongestWord()`, that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.

- Write a method, `filterLongWords()`, that takes an array of words and a number, `i`, and returns the word(s) in the array that are longer than `i` characters.

#### Starter Code

There is no starter code for this lab.

#### Deliverable

You'll review the answers with the instructor in class.
