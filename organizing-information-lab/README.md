# Organizing Information With Collections Lab

## Introduction

> **Instructor Note**: This should be completed independently.

In this lab, you'll be completing a series of three challenge problems involving data collections. These problems are similar to what you would see in an interview, so this is great practice. Think through each problem before you start creating code, possibly writing out pseudocode if it will help you. Run your code against the included test cases when you're finished.

**Feel free to look up any Java documentation to help you (i.e., arrays, Lists, and others). Although you can find the solutions on the internet, it's to your benefit to try solving these problems on your own.**

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Complete each problem in its own provided method.
- Your methods must pass all of the included test cases.

**Bonus**
- Complete the bonus problem (marked as "Bonus").
- Optimize your methods to be more efficient.

#### Starter Code

An **IntelliJ project** called `ChallengeQuestions` has been provided for you. It includes a `Main.java` file. Each method has a comment above it that contains the problem. Complete each problem in that method (although you can write additional methods if it will help in your solution). Run your code against the test cases when you're done.

#### Deliverable

A completed Java file with solutions to the problems.

#### Test Your Code

Use the included JUnit test cases. Right click the `MainTest.java` file and choose `Run MainTest`.
